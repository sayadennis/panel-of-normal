# Evaluation of GATK Panel of Normals

## Background 

Many institutions have a large collection of preserved tissue samples of cancerous or benign origin. In order to study the genomic profiles of these samples, it is necessary to differentiate which genomic characteristics, such as DNA sequence variations and copy-number variations, are from germline (i.e. patient is born with these variations) or somatic (i.e. the variation accumulated after both). The Broad Institute's [GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us) has developed a tool called [Panel of Normals (PON)](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890631-Panel-of-Normals-PON-), in which we can generate a representative collection of "normal" samples to be used to characterize the somatic genomic aberrations.
